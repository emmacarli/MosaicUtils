gen_regionfile.py


Creates a DS9 region file with ellipses with desired coordinates & sizes. Useful for overlaying on a PSF generated by tilesim.py
to check that suspected sidelobe detections match up with predicted sidelobe positions.
Just edit the ras, decs, widths, heights, and pas arrays with the parameters of the ellipeses you want, and run the script. Generates
a "regionfile.reg" that can be imported into DS9.
